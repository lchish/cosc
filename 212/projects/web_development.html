    <h1>Web development</h1>
    <div id="left">
      <p>Web development is a broad term for any activity related to developing
	a web site for the World Wide Web or an internet. This can include
	e-commerce business development, web design, web content development,
	client-side/server-side scripting, and web server
	configuration. However, among web professionals, "web development"
	usually refers only to the non-design aspects of building web sites,
	e.g. writing markup and coding. Web development can range from
	developing the simplest static single page of plain text to the most
	complex web-based internet applications, electronic businesses, or
	social network services.</p>

      <p class ="a">For larger businesses and organizations, web development teams can
	consist of hundreds of people (web developers). Smaller organizations
	may only require a single permanent or contracting webmaster, or
	secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic
	designer and/or Information systems technician. Web development may be
	a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a
	designated department.</p>

      <h2>Web development as an industry</h2>

      <p>Since the mid-1990s, web development has been one of the fastest
	growing industries in the world. In 1995 there were fewer than 1,000
	web development companies in the United States alone, but by 2005
	there were over 30,000 such companies.  The web development industry
	is expected to grow over 20% by 2010. The growth of this industry is
	being pushed by large businesses wishing to sell products and services
	to their customers and to automate business workflow.</p>

      <p class ="a">In addition, cost of Web site development and hosting has dropped
	dramatically during this time. Instead of costing tens of thousands of
	dollars, as was the case for early websites, one can now develop a
	simple web site for less than a thousand dollars, depending on the
	complexity and amount of content.  Smaller Web site
	development companies are now able to make web design accessible to
	both smaller companies and individuals further fueling the growth of
	the web development industry. As far as web development tools and
	platforms are concerned, there are many systems available to the
	public free of charge to aid in development. A popular example is the
	LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), which is usually distributed free of
	charge. This fact alone has manifested into many people around the
	globe setting up new Web sites daily and thus contributing to increase
	in web development popularity. Another contributing factor has been
	the rise of easy to use WYSIWYG web development software, most
	prominently WebDev, Adobe Dreamweaver or Microsoft Expression Studio
	(formerly Microsoft Frontpage) . Using such software, virtually anyone
	can develop a Web page in a matter of minutes. Knowledge of HyperText
	Markup Language (HTML), or other programming languages is not
	required, but recommended for professional results.</p>

      <p class ="a">The next generation of web development tools uses the strong growth in
	LAMP and Microsoft .NET technologies to provide the Web as a way to
	run applications online. Web developers now help to deliver
	applications as Web services which were traditionally only available
	as applications on a desk based computer.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="right">
      <p class ="a">Instead of running executable code on a local computer, users are
	interacting with online applications to create new content. This has
	created new methods in communication and allowed for many
	opportunities to decentralize information and media
	distribution. Users are now able to interact with applications from
	many locations, instead of being tied to a specific workstation for
	their application environment.</p>

      <p class ="a">Examples of dramatic transformation in communication and commerce led
	by web development include e-commerce. Online auction sites such as
	eBay have changed the way consumers consume and purchase goods and
	services. Online resellers such as Amazon.com and Buy.com (among many,
	many others) have transformed the shopping and bargain hunting
	experience for many consumers. Another good example of transformative
	communication led by web development is the blog. Web applications
	such as MovableType and WordPress have created easily implemented blog
	environments for individual Web sites. Open source content systems
	such as Alfresco, Typo3, Xoops, Joomla!, and Drupal have extended web
	development into new modes of interaction and communication.</p>


      <h3>Security Considerations</h3>

      <p>Web development takes into account many security considerations, such
	as data entry error checking through forms, filtering output, and
	encryption.  Malicious practices such as SQL injection can be executed
	by users with ill intent yet with only primitive knowledge of web
	development as a whole. Not only this, but scripts can be exploited to
	grant unauthorized access to malicious users trying to collect
	information such as email addresses, passwords and protected content
	like credit card numbers.</p>

      <p class ="a">Some of this is dependent on the server environment (most commonly
	Apache or Microsoft IIS) on which the scripting language, such as PHP,
	Ruby, Python, Perl or ASP is running, and therefore is not necessarily
	down to the web developer themselves to maintain. However, stringent
	testing of web applications before public release is encouraged to
	prevent such exploits from occurring.</p>

      <p class ="a">Keeping a web server safe from intrusion is often called Server Port
	Hardening. Many technologies come into play when keeping information
	on the internet safe when it is transmitted from one location to
	another. For instance Secure Socket Layer Encryption (SSL)
	Certificates are issued by certificate authorities to help prevent
	internet fraud. Many developers often employ different forms of
	encryption when transmitting and storing sensitive information. A
	basic understanding of information technology security concerns is
	often part of a web developer's knowledge.</p>

      <p class ="a">Because new security holes are found in web applications even after
	testing and launch, security patch updates are frequent for widely
	used applications. It is often the job of web developers to keep
	applications up to date as security patches are released and new
	security concerns are discovered.</p>
